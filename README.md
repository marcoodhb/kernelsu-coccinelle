# KernelSU Coccinelle

This repository contains semantic patches that can be used to apply so-called “manual” KernelSU hooks on a wide range of Android kernels without needing to do anything manually or fixing any conflicts. These patches are written in Coccinelle's excellent Semantic Patch Language (SmPL) which operates on the *code structure* rather unlike `diff` and `git diff`.

These patches are much more robust and universal than diffs. In addition to working on a wide range of kernel versions, they don't care about comments, spacing, crappy vendor kernel backports, most variable names, etc. The downside is that they are *much* harder to create and the documentation is sparse. Now, today is your lucky day because I already went through all the trouble myself so that you can stay blissfully unaware of how it actually works.

# Hook types

There are two flavors of the patches needed to integrate KernelSU and its forks into your kernel:

## 1. [Classic hooks](https://github.com/devnoname120/kernelsu-coccinelle/tree/main/classic-hooks)

Those are a re-implementation of the OG “manual hooks” as semantic patches with some additional required backports. These are the most basic and have the best compatibility with OG KernelSU* and its forks.

 👉 See [`classic-hooks/README.md`](classic-hooks/README.md).

## 2. [Scope-minimized hooks](https://github.com/devnoname120/kernelsu-coccinelle/tree/main/scope-minimized-hooks)

These hooks are mostly based on [@backslashxx](https://github.com/backslashxx)'s scope-minimized hooks v1.3 + ultra-legacy + lots of backports + I read an insane number of vendor custom Android kernel sources to properly handle all cases and their quirks.

Use these if your kernel version is not supported by the `classic-hooks` or if you like to live dangerously. Note that these are *not* supported by OG KSU best used in combination with [KernelSU Next](https://github.com/KernelSU-Next/KernelSU-Next) as other forks may miss some of the commits that are required for the scope-minimized hooks to work.

👉 See [`scope-minimized-hooks/README.md`](scope-minimized-hooks/README.md).
